2026-02-12 10:35:31,EU AI Act Analysis,Summarize the requirements for high-risk AI systems.,"### Direct Answer: High-risk AI systems in the EU must adhere to stringent requirements including data governance, transparency, human oversight, risk management, accuracy, robustness, cybersecurity, conformity assessment, post-market monitoring, technical documentation, and record-keeping. These systems are classified based on their potential impact on health, safety, and fundamental rights, and must comply with the Artificial Intelligence Act and other relevant regulations.  ### Key Context: 1. **Classification**: High-risk AI systems include those used as safety components of products and stand-alone systems with significant implications for fundamental rights. 2. **Regulatory Framework**: Governed by the Artificial Intelligence Act and other key regulations, ensuring safety, compliance, and ethical use. 3. **Specific Requirements**:    - **Data Governance**: High-quality, relevant, and representative data must be used.    - **Transparency**: Systems must be operationally transparent, with detailed information provided to users.    - **Human Oversight**: Effective human oversight measures must be in place to prevent or minimize risks.    - **Risk Management**: A comprehensive risk management system must be established and maintained throughout the AI system's lifecycle.    - **Accuracy, Robustness, and Cybersecurity**: Systems must achieve an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.    - **Conformity Assessment**: Providers must ensure their systems undergo a relevant conformity assessment procedure before market release.    - **Post-Market Monitoring**: Providers must establish a post-market monitoring system to collect, document, and analyze data on AI system performance.    - **Technical Documentation**: Technical documentation must be prepared and kept up-to-date to demonstrate compliance with relevant requirements.    - **Record-Keeping and Logging**: Systems must be designed to automatically record events during operation, ensuring traceability. 4. **Obligations for Providers, Users, and Other Participants**: Clear roles and responsibilities are outlined for providers, importers, distributors, users, and notified bodies. 5. **Governance and Implementation**: Includes the establishment of the European Artificial Intelligence Board, national competent authorities, and an EU-wide database for high-risk AI systems. 6. **Prohibited Practices**: Certain harmful practices, such as those that distort human behavior or exploit vulnerabilities, are prohibited. 7. **Consistency with Existing Legislation**: The regulatory framework is consistent with existing EU legislation, including the GDPR and sectoral safety legislation. 8. **Fundamental Rights Protection**: The framework aims to protect fundamental rights such as human dignity, privacy, non-discrimination, and equality.  ### Detailed Table/Audit: #### 11.1.
