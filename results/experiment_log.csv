2026-02-11 11:03:13,EU AI Act Analysis,Summarize the requirements for high-risk AI systems.,"The requirements for high-risk AI systems are outlined in Chapter 2 of the EU AI Act. These requirements include:  1. **Risk Management System (Article 9)**:    - Establish, implement, document, and maintain a risk management system throughout the AI system's lifecycle.    - Identify, analyze, and evaluate known and foreseeable risks.    - Adopt suitable risk management measures, including elimination or reduction of risks and implementation of mitigation and control measures.    - Ensure high-risk AI systems perform consistently and comply with the requirements set out in Chapter 2.  2. **Data and Data Governance (Article 10)**:    - Develop AI systems on the basis of high-quality training, validation, and testing data sets.    - Ensure data sets are relevant, representative, free of errors, and complete.    - Take into account the specific geographical, behavioural, or functional setting within which the AI system is intended to be used.  3. **Technical Documentation (Article 11)**:    - Draw up technical documentation before placing the system on the market or putting it into service.    - Keep the documentation up-to-date.    - The documentation should demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 and provide all necessary information to assess compliance.  4. **Record-Keeping (Article 12)**:    - Design and develop AI systems with capabilities enabling the automatic recording of events ('logs') while the system is operating.    - Ensure a level of traceability of the AI system's functioning throughout its lifecycle.    - Enable monitoring of the operation of the high-risk AI system with respect to the occurrence of situations that may result in the AI system presenting a risk.  5. **Transparency and Provision of Information to Users (Article 13)**:    - Ensure the operation of high-risk AI systems is sufficiently transparent to enable users to interpret the system's output and use it appropriately.    - Accompany high-risk AI systems with instructions for use in an appropriate digital format or otherwise that include concise, complete, correct, and clear information that is relevant, accessible, and comprehensible to users.  6. **Human Oversight (Article 14)**:    - Design and develop high-risk AI systems in such a way, including with appropriate human-machine interface tools, that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which the AI system is in use.    - Human oversight should aim at preventing or minimizing the risks to health, safety, or fundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse.  7. **Accuracy, Robustness, and Cybersecurity (Article 15)**:    - Design and develop high-risk AI systems in such a way that they achieve, in the light of their intended purpose, an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity, and perform consistently in those respects throughout their lifecycle.    - Ensure high-risk AI systems are resilient as regards errors, faults, or inconsistencies that may occur within the system or the environment in which the system operates.    - Ensure high-risk AI systems are resilient as regards attempts by unauthorized third parties to alter their use or performance by exploiting the system vulnerabilities.  These requirements are designed to ensure that high-risk AI systems are safe, transparent, and accountable, and that they protect the fundamental rights of individuals.",20.62s,aiact.txt
2026-02-11 11:03:30,EU AI Act Analysis,What are the prohibited AI practices according to Article 5?,"The prohibited AI practices according to Article 5 are as follows:  1. **AI systems intended to distort human behavior**: The placing on the market, putting into service, or use of certain AI systems intended to distort human behavior, whereby physical or psychological harms are likely to occur, is forbidden. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components individuals cannot perceive or exploit vulnerabilities of children and people due to their age, physical or mental incapacities. They do so with the intention to materially distort the behavior of a person and in a manner that causes or is likely to cause harm to that or another person. The intention may not be presumed if the distortion of human behavior results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the provider or the user.  2. **AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons for general purpose by public authorities or on their behalf**: AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons for general purpose by public authorities or on their behalf may lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups. They may violate the right to dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. Such AI systems evaluate or classify the trustworthiness of natural persons based on their social behavior in multiple contexts or known or predicted personal or personality characteristics. The social score obtained from such AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behavior. Such AI systems should be therefore prohibited.  3. **Use of AI systems for 'real-time' remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement**: The use of AI systems for 'real-time' remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is considered particularly intrusive in the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems operating in 'real-time' carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities. The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be prohibited, except in three exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for potential victims of crime, including missing children; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the detection, localisation, identification or prosecution of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences referred to in Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA if those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State.",16.8s,aiact.txt
