2026-02-12 13:10:26,EU AI Act Analysis,What are the prohibited AI practices according to Article 5?,"### Prohibited AI Practices According to Article 5  **Direct Answer:** Article 5 of the AI Act outlines specific AI practices that are explicitly prohibited to protect fundamental rights and Union values. These practices include the use of subliminal techniques, exploitation of vulnerabilities, social scoring, real-time remote biometric identification, and deep fakes without appropriate safeguards.  **Key Technical Facts:** - **Subliminal Techniques**: AI systems that use subliminal techniques to distort behavior and cause harm. - **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**: AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities of specific groups to distort behavior and cause harm. - **Social Scoring**: AI systems used by public authorities to evaluate or classify trustworthiness based on social behavior, leading to detrimental treatment. - **Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification**: AI systems used for law enforcement purposes in publicly accessible spaces, unless strictly necessary for specific objectives. - **Deep Fakes**: AI systems that generate or manipulate content to create deep fakes without disclosure, except when authorized by law or necessary for freedom of expression and
